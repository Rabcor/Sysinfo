# Sysinfo
A quick and easy bash script that prints basic system information (Motherboard, CPU, RAM/Swap, GPU)

Dependencies:

mesa-demos (glxinfo)
lm-sensors (for temperature readings)

Please share if you notice any bugs, I have not tested this on any AMD hardware (it should work though) so any feedback would be nice.
